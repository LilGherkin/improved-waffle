## Protect Your Master Branch Tutorial
* **Part I**: Protect Master
* Navigate to your repo's "Settings" page. Select "master" under the "Branch protection rules" dropdown. Then on the next screen, select the following options:
 1. "Protect this branch"
 2. "Require pull request reviews before merging"
 3. "Require review from Code Owners"
 4. "Include administrators"
* **Part II**: Set Up Continuous Deployment
* Go back to your repo's main "Settings" page and scroll down to the "Github Pages" section. Select "master branch" from the dropdown and save.
* You should be provided a URL for the deployed app if you scroll back down to this section. It may take a few minutes for the website to deploy. Ask an instructor or TA for assistance if you can't verify this worked.
* **Hints**:
* Ensure the there's an index.html file at the root of the repo.
